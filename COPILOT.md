# Copilot Context

This repository uses OpenSpec for spec-driven development. When working on specs or change proposals, follow the workflow in [openspec/AGENTS.md](openspec/AGENTS.md).

Quick rules for Copilot agents:
- Read `openspec/project.md` and `openspec/contributing.md` before making spec changes.
- Use OpenSpec change proposals for new capabilities, breaking changes, or architecture shifts.
- Follow branch naming: `feature/site(<spec#>)-<feature-short-name>` for OpenSpec work.
- Update `.agents/context/glossary.md` with a brief branch summary.
- Check CI status and address Copilot review comments before marking work complete.
